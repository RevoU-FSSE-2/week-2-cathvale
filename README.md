# Hi, Welcome to my Repository!

My name is Catherine, and I am a Software Engineering student in RevoU for batch June 2023.

On this week, we were given a task to create responsive website using HTML and CSS.

For the topic of this website, I choose to create a Itinerary list website, where user can create their own website or ask AI to create the Itinerary for them.

Here's a sneakpeak of the website.
